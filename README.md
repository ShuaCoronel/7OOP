### ABOUT ME :hear_no_evil:
<small>My name is Joshua, I am not the brightest student and tend to be quite *pessimistic*, but I will struggle with all my might to earn my keep.<small>
<small>I just.... lose hope sometimes! <small>

### WHAT I BELIEVE IN 
- "The world is unfair, and effort has no value."
- "Be great in act as you have in thought."
- *"The moment of the clouds and the rain is as near to heaven as they can get."*

we didn't know that the dead ones, are the lucky ones! :black_heart:
